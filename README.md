# Argus

Argus (the all seeing one) is an Android app that tracks and manages streaming video watching activities.

The vision for Argus is to provide an app that allows a User to:

1) add and persist video titles associated with a network name, which identifies the organization providing the video: Hulu, Netflix, HBO, etc.
2) identify the type of video: movie, tv show, something else
3) start, stop, pause or resume watching a selected video
4) seamlessly obtain information from a video database (IMDB) for the selected video
...

In providing these features, Argus normalizes the myriad different experiences one might encounter in watching streamed videos.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Run the tests using the Gradle connectedCheck task: ```./gradlew connectedCheck```

After a successful test run, examine the code coverage data for that test run by viewing ...app/build/reports/coverage/debug/com.pajato.argus/index.html

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
